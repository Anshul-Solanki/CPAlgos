# Elliptic Curve Cryptography Algorithm

The major advantage of ECC is that it provides encryption keys of smaller length compared to RSA with same level of security (more technical explaination in later section). This would optimize E2E performance of any application using this encryption, wrt. encryption time and memory usage. However ECC has potential vulnerabilities which can be exloited by attackers, it requires selection of params carefully, to be standardised by experts who understand the real mathematical complexity of elliptic curve.
